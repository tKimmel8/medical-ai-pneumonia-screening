## Confusion Matrix

![Confusion Matrix](link_to_confusion_matrix_image)

The Confusion Matrix shows the performance of the model. It provides insight into the true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative rates, which are critical for assessing model efficacy.

![Precision-Recall Curve](link_to_precision_recall_curve_image)

The Precision-Recall Curve illustrates the trade-off between precision and recall for different probability thresholds. A curve closer to the top right corner indicates better precision and recall.

![ROC Curve](link_to_roc_curve_image)

The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve demonstrates the model’s diagnostic ability as its discrimination threshold is varied. A curve closer to the top left corner indicates a better model.

Activation localizes to parenchymal opacification regions consistent with pneumonia patterns.
